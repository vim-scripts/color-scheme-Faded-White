This is a light color scheme that looks as though it's been through the wash a few too many times. 

The background isn't quite white and the colors aren't full color. Fairly good contrast and easy on the eyes.

NOTE:
I have not adjusted the terminal colors from my "faded-black" color scheme (vimscript#4398).
